import Underlining from "../../../src/styles/underlining"

My experience in the sciences has gotten me involved in various industries including water, chemical, and utilities.

However, none of these industries have piqued my curiosity and interest quite like technology. After having serendipitously stumbled upon the field of web development, I had found a new passion in life.

My particular area of focus has been the MERN stack, but I am always eager and willing to learn new technologies!
